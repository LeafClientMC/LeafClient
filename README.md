A ___Minecraft: Java Edition client (no cheats)___.
(and possibly supporting Bedrock Edition soon)

# 🏗️ REVAMPING

We're revamping Leaf Client, entirely.
This is going to release in approx 1-2 months (maybe less time), and it's going to include in-game features just like other popular clients, and performance mods to improve gameplay.
Not to mention, this will be **cross-platform**, just like other clients. Previously, this only supported Windows OS.

### Preview

This client will feature relatively smooth UI, way more performance and FPS within the launcher and possibly the game depending on the performance mods you select.

## 🤔 Open Source?

Yes, this will be an **open source project**. Parts of the project that include sensitive information (for when we add Cosmetics, etc) will be left out of the source code for safety. The same applies for our in-game client with features. This may be the first open source professional launcher that also features an in-game client.

## 🛠️ Contributors

Just me. I'm a solo on this project, and I also had to [modify CmlLib's source code](https://github.com/voidZiAD/CmlLib-XboxAuthNet.AOTCompatible) in order to make it work within the launcher. 

## 🎯 Project Goal

I'm aiming to add everything that someone would usually expect within a professional client and launcher (e.g. Lunar/Badlion), but mostly for free. Monetization in this project would only be through launcher banner ads, cosmetics, and possibly a subscription in the future. I'm also aiming to make it more customizable and add more creative features that probably aren't in the popular clients we use day-to-day. I'm a person who appreciates feedback, and I'm all for listening to what the people want. Feel free to suggest.

## 🗃️ Project Status

This project is still under development, and isn't accessible by the public. Once it is, it will be the first revamped Leaf Client Beta version.
