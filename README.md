A ___Minecraft: Java Edition client (no cheats)___.
(and possibly supporting Bedrock Edition soon)

# 🏗️ REVAMPING

We're revamping Leaf Client, entirely.
This is going to release in approx 1-2 months (maybe less time), and it's going to include in-game features just like other popular clients, and performance mods to improve gameplay.
Not to mention, this will be **cross-platform**, just like other clients. Previously, this only supported Windows OS.

### Preview

This client will feature relatively smooth UI, way more performance and FPS within the launcher and possibly the game depending on the performance mods you select.

## 🤔 Open Source?

Yes, this will be an **open source project**. Parts of the project that include sensitive information (for when we add Cosmetics, etc) will be left out of the source code for safety. The same applies for our in-game client with features. This may be the first open source professional launcher that also features an in-game client. I'm open to possible contributions as well.

## 🛠️ Contributors

Just me. I'm a solo on this project, and I also had to [modify CmlLib's source code](https://github.com/voidZiAD/CmlLib-XboxAuthNet.AOTCompatible) in order to make it work within the launcher.
\
Unlike the previous versions of LeafClient (that are now deleted), the in-game features are fully coded by myself, with the help of intelligent problem-solving LLMs to speed up the process. Meaning, the only possible usage of other people's mods are either through yourself downloading them into the mods folder, or installing a mod through our mods page, which gives credit to the owner of the mod by default.

## 💎 Indirect Contributors (APIs)

[StarlightSkins](https://starlightskins.lunareclipse.studio) for the in-launcher skin rendering with emotes.\
[Visage](https://vzge.me/) for the in-launcher substitute skin rendering.\
[Modrinth API](https://api.modrinth.com) for the in-launcher mod installation.\
[CmlLib](https://github.com/CmlLib) for Cross-platform MS Authentication, Minecraft Launching, etc.\
[McStatusIO](https://api.mcstatus.io) for Minecraft Server Status checks.

## 🎯 Project Goal

**IMPORTANT: WE'RE NOT FOR PROFIT.**
\
Majority of the features provided, will be of no cost. We're going to prioritize banner ads as we progress as a client, with no pop-up/in-stream ads. Just ads sitting on the launcher screen.

I'm aiming to add everything that someone would usually expect within a professional client and launcher (e.g. Lunar/Badlion), but mostly for free. Monetization in this project would only be through launcher banner ads, cosmetics, and possibly a subscription in the future. There will be no in-game paid features except a few Cosmetics, the rest of the features will be free. I'm also aiming to make it more customizable and add more creative features that probably aren't in the popular clients we use day-to-day. I'm a person who appreciates feedback, and I'm all for listening to what the people want. Feel free to suggest.

## 🗃️ Project Status

This project is still under development, and isn't accessible by the public. Once it is, it will be the first revamped Leaf Client Beta version.
